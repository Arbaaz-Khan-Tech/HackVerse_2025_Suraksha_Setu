#  **Problem Statement:**  
Innovative Idea on autonomous surveillance system using data fusion of various sensors (Camera, laser, buried optic fibre, UGS etc)

#  **Issues Based On Selected Problem Statement:**  
Citizens in India face safety concerns due to delayed police responses, while police struggle with inefficiency and manual processes. Our project bridges this gap using AI and real-time communication to enhance safety and productivity.
